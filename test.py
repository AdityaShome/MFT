Fixed Code from errornomous.py

Changes Made:
1. Added try-except block in division_error to handle ZeroDivisionError.
2. Implemented logging instead of print statements for error handling.
3. Added type hints for better code readability and to enforce type checking.
4. Removed the hanging function at the end to prevent an unintended infinite loop.
5. Added a basic unit test suite to validate the functionality of each error simulation function.
6. Used contextlib.suppress to handle expected exceptions where traceback is not needed, improving readability.
7. Implemented a safer way to handle files that might not exist, avoiding unnecessary exceptions.
8. Added a check in division_error to prevent division by zero without relying solely on exception handling.
9. Included documentation for each function to explain its purpose and usage.
10. Optimized performance by avoiding repeated random.choice calls in division_error.

Why These Changes Were Made:
- To improve code robustness through proper exception handling and logging.
- To enhance code maintainability and readability through type hints and comments.
- To ensure the code is self-testing and reliable by adding unit tests.
- To prevent runtime errors and improve user experience by handling edge cases and input validation.
- To follow Python best practices, making the code more scalable and secure.

How They Improve the Code:
- Logging provides a more structured way to track errors and issues.
- Type hints and documentation make the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Unit tests ensure that each function behaves as expected, catching regressions early.
- Handling edge cases and input validation prevents unexpected behavior and crashes.

Breaking Changes:
- The removal of the unintended infinite loop at the end changes the program's behavior by allowing it to terminate properly.

Required Testing:
- Unit tests have been added to validate each error simulation function.
- Additional integration testing is recommended to ensure all components work together as expected.

Dependencies Added or Modified:
- Added `logging` for error logging.
- Added `unittest` for the unit test suite.

Performance Considerations:
- The changes should not significantly impact performance. The use of logging and exception handling is standard and should not introduce noticeable overhead.

Security Implications:
- Proper error handling and logging improve security by avoiding exposing sensitive error information.

Known Limitations:
- This script is designed for demonstration purposes and may not cover all possible error handling scenarios in a production environment.

Future Improvements:
- Expand the unit test suite to cover more edge cases.
- Implement a more sophisticated logging configuration, including file handlers and log rotation.
- Consider adding more complex error simulation functions to cover additional Python exceptions.
